# bombasticModel
A simplified model of the game Bombastic as assignment for the constraint programming class, I took during my MSc.
The model is writen in Essense Prime and can be compiled and solved with [Savile Row](https://savilerow.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/)
Any model consists of two files: the model file `.eprime` detailing the constraints of the model and the parameter file `.param` which contains the paramters needed to definte the problem instance. The parameter files in the root folder were written by [Ian Miguel](https://ianm.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) the rest of the files were written by me.
